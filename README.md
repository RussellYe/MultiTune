# MultiTune
Description of this porject:
Adaptive Integration of Multiple Fine-tuning Models in Transfer Learning for Image Classification
This project is an individual research project submitted to The Autralian National University (ANU).
In this project, a novel technique that can be used in Transfer Learning (TL) is proposed, which enables the adaptive 
integration of multiple fine-tuning models with different fine-tuning settings. It is denoted as MultiTune. 
The approach of MultiTune is used in TL for image classification in this project. The datasets used 
are two datasets from Visual Decathlon Dataset (Rebuffi, Bilen, and Vedaldi, 2017), which are the 
Aircraft and the Cifar100 datasets. Due to the size limit, only the Aircraft dataset is uploaded in this 
GitHub project. The Cifar100 dataset can be donwloaded from https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/decathlon/#download
After donwloading, put the dataset in the decathlon-1.0-data folder.
